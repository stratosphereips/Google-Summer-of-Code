We expect you to get motivated by the projects and to get involved in how to make them better! 

You will have to work around 4hs per day (small projects) to 6hs per day (large project), during 12 weeks (22 weeks max if we agree). 

We can agree in your time off, and holidays and how to better work with us. 

To get approved in your work during the summer you will be required to present a report 
and Google will ask us an evaluation of your work. This will happen twice during the summer.


If you want to work on an issue from the slips repo, we highly encourage you to do so as a form of contributing and it will give you a higher chance of being accepted. but tasks from slips issues are going to be outside the GSoC. for GSoC 2023 we will stick to the 3 Ideas in our ideas list.

Since we got many questions about the evaluation, the following points would greatly affect your ranking: 


 - Early bird gets the worm! Send us your proposals early, maybe before
   sending them to Google. the earlier the better.
 - In your application, tell us which idea you want to work on, you can
   choose one of the 3 ideas in our ideas list. also if you have a
   really great idea that is worth 3 months of implementation we would
   love to hear about it!
 - Tell us in detail how you're planning to implement the idea you
   chose. divide it into smaller tasks, tell us the technologies you're
   going to use, and tell us if you've done something similar before.
 - Purpose initial milestones, we will plan it in more detail later if
   you're accepted, but we would like to know how you estimate each task
   and plan the timeline.
 - Show us your skills and experience, links to side projects would be
   great, and demonstrating your skills by fixing small issues from the
   slips repo would greatly affect your ranking.

    
Remember that showing us your skills is way better than listing them ðŸ˜‰
