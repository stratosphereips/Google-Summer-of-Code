# Slips

## Improvement of Slips web interface
- Better Display of timewindow numbers,  start time, and end time
- Showing all the info we have on each profile.
- Show a list of Blocked Profiles in one place
- Show the history of threat levels and confidence of each profile
- If an IPv4 profile has an available IPv6 we should show it. and vice versa
- Show the current threat level of each profile 
- Show the user agent of each profile 
- Show the MAC of each profile
- Live (Asynchronous) updating of the web view. (meaning that without refreshing the page, new info should be displayed)
- Show slips logo somewhere
- Showing about a profile
- Progress bar if possible
- List of loaded modules and disabled modules
- Show current model status (are we in training or testing mode)
- Show the current gateway’s IP and MAC, an mark the gateway profile as ‘Gateway’
- Have a whitelist tab to show what IPs/domains/orgs are currently whitelisted
- Manage the configuration of slips from the web
	- Change the feeds : JA3 feeds, SSL feeds, TI feeds
	- Whitelist
	- Manage API keys: VT, riskIQ, slack bot token
	- Warden.conf
	- Slips.conf
	- Local TI files

## Better Installation and usage

- An easy way to install slips, Any of the following:
  - using apt
  - snap
  - dpkg
- Now slips runs from it's main directory, after installing it using apt the goal would be to use slips from any directory, so this would require changing slips code to use absolute directories, adding slips to PATH etc.
- Support auto starting slips daemon on startup   
- Bonus: brew installation of slips (if the student has a macOS)  

## Improve Performance

- CPU Profiling; Using python profilers: for example profile and cProfile modules or others
- Memory Profiling; Using memray, Memory Profiler module or others that may do
- Provide statistics and graphs about which parts or modules of slips need optimizations
- Provide optimization ideas; what can be done differently? Why and How?

## Machine Learning detection

- Anomaly detection methods
	- Detect anomalies in the amount of traffic send and received
	- Detect anomalies in the HTTP User Agents
	- Detect anomalies in the IP addresses each host connects TO and receives FROM
	- Detect anomalies in the countries if the destination IPs an IP connects to 
	- Adapt the retraining module of AD for users to adapt models to their traffic
- Supervised detection methods
	- Improve the detection of C&C channels using the stratoletters by retraining in new dataset
	- Detect DGA by using sequence models or transformers
