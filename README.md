Effective communication is critical for working with our team, particularly in the context of remote collaboration. We are looking for individuals who are proactive in sharing ideas, updates on their progress, and any challenges they encounter. 

We strive to foster an environment where team members feel comfortable seeking assistance and support, where everyone's contributions are valued, and communication is seamless.

Throughout the duration of the GSoC Program, we will have weekly meetings with all collaborators to share the progress, check on problems and blockers, and discuss ideas.
