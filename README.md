This is the repository with all the information you need to know about the Google Summer of Code for Stratosphere Laboratory 2024

## About the Stratosphere Laboratory
Stratosphere conducts research at the intersection of machine learning, cybersecurity and helping others by developing free software tools. We are part of the AI Center, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague.

## Google Summer of Code

The [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open-source software development. 
Accepted GSoC Contributors work with an open-source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors. For small projects, students are expected to work 4 hours per day. For large projects, students are expected to work 6 hours per day.
Throughout the program, students undergo two evaluations based on accomplished work milestones, timely delivery, and their interaction with the mentors.

## Stratosphere Projects Open for Contribution

This year, we are accepting proposals for two projects:
- Slips: a free software behavioral Python intrusion prevention system (IDS/IPS) that uses machine learning to detect malicious behaviors in the network traffic. [[List of Ideas](list_of_ideas.md)] [[GitHub](https://github.com/stratosphereips/StratosphereLinuxIPS)]
- AI VPN: A Free-Software AI-Powered Network Forensics Tool [[List of Ideas](list_of_ideas.md)] [[GitHub](https://github.com/stratosphereips/AIVPN)]

## Communication
Effective communication is critical for working with our team, particularly in the context of remote collaboration. We are looking for individuals who are proactive in sharing ideas, updates on their progress, and any challenges they encounter. 

We strive to foster an environment where team members feel comfortable seeking assistance and support, where everyone's contributions are valued, and communication is seamless.

Throughout the duration of the GSoC Program, we will have weekly meetings with all collaborators to share the progress, check on problems and blockers, and discuss ideas.
